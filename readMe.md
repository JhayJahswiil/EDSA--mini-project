Instructions:
Create an HTML page with a form that contains a text input field and a submit button.
Add CSS styling to the form to make it visually appealing.
Use JavaScript to create an event listener for the submit button.
In the event listener, get the value of the text input field and perform the following operations on the string:
	

		
* Count the number of characters in the string.
* Count the number of words in the string.	
* Reverse the string.	
* Convert the string to uppercase.
* Convert the string to lowercase.
	

Display the results of the operations on the string in the HTML page, below the form.

Use media queries to make the page responsive and mobile-friendly.

This mini project will help you build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple web page that allows users to interact with the content. It will also help you understand how to use event listeners and manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.
